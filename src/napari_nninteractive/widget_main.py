    A widget for the nnInteractive plugin in Napari that manages model inference sessions
    and allows interactive layer-based actions.

    Handling the in-progress object when a session ends
    ---------------------------------------------------
    Whenever a live session is torn down we have to decide what happens to the
    object the user is currently working on (the un-committed "nnInteractive -
    Label Layer"). The behaviour deliberately splits along *why* the session
    ended:

    * **User-triggered reinitialization** -- changing the model, the Local/Remote
      mode, the server URL/key (``on_model_selected``), the local checkpoint
      (``on_checkpoint_changed``) or a baked-in option such as torch.compile or
      the interaction storage backend (``on_local_settings_changed``). The new
      session cannot meaningfully continue the old object, so we *wrap it up*:
      ``_store_in_progress_segmentation`` commits it as a finished object (exactly
      like "Next Object") and the user starts fresh on the next Initialize. If
      they don't want the stored object they can simply delete the layer.

    * **Unintentional loss** -- the remote lease expired or the connection dropped
      (``_handle_session_expired``). The user did not ask to stop, so we instead
      *resume*: the label layer is kept and the resume machinery
      (``_resume_after_reconnect`` / ``_resume_image_layer`` / ``_resuming``,
      consumed in ``LayerControls.on_init``) seeds the reconnected session with it
      so refinement continues on the same object.

    In short: deliberate resets bank the work and start over; accidental drops
    preserve and resume it.
